# 6. Deployment

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The site was deployed to Heroku using the following steps:

- If necessary, the packages that were added to the file on this project were placed in the requirements.txt file.
- Before deploying the project, a heroku account had to be made.
- First, heroku will ask for the user's basic information.
- This includes their first and last name, their email address, their role and the primary development language.
- A statement would then pop up asking for the user to accept their terms and conditions.
- The account has been created.
- On the heroku dashboard, the create new app button is clicked.
- A name which hasn't been used before has to be given to the app.
- Choose a region, which is Europe in my case.
- Complete the settings tab first.
- Press the button that says settings on the navigation bar.
- If the user has any sensitive or personal data, it should be placed in the Config Vars section.
- Press the reveal config vars button.
- Add in the name of the file that should be placed in capital letters in the first blank space.
- Add in the actual code in the file named above into the second blank space.
- Press add.
- Then press the buildpack button below.
- Select python from the selection given to you and press save changes.
- Press buildpack again and this time select nodejs and save changes.
- Make sure the python is on top of the nodejs.
- After this, press the deploy button on the navigation bar.
- Select Github from the three options give.
- Press connect to Github.
- Type in the name of the Github account the user is working with.
- Type in the name of the repository.
- Click Search.
- Click connect which would connect the github code to the heroku app.
- Make sure the branch is the main branch.
- Press deploy branch.
- If you want heroku to automatically build your code after pushing it to github each time, press enable automatic deploy.
- Your pogramme has now been deployed.
- Press view to view your programme.

* For the Readme file, I took the structure from my previous Readme file and used it here. Reference is given to https://github.com/dhakal79/Portfolio-project-MS1 which is the readme file I took into consideration when I was doing my first one.

* The ideas and code I implemented into this project were taught to me by Code Institute.
* My mentor Marcel Mulders supported me throughout the whole project. I couldn't have done it without his help.
